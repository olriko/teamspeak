# Teamspeak CI ðŸš€
A project to deploy and manage easily your teamspeak server with **DigitalOcean** and **Github CI** Workflow.
By default, it runs a free teamspeak license which means that it's a 32 user's slots server with the smallest DigitalOcean VPS which costs only **5 dollars** per month.

> Even if you are not friendly with github, it's really easy to create a Teamspeak server. You can watch out this [youtube guide (french)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB1nXV665uI).
